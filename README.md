I created this project as a Challenge in this Coding Bootcamp to assess my knowledge and skill level in HTML, CSS, and most importantly JavaScript with emphasis to Third Party API's. This application uses a Third Party API to allow the application to get the day and the time. This application also allows the user to save events for each hour of the day. User generated data is then saved in local storage and user is asked if they prefer to Save Data or Clear Data.
